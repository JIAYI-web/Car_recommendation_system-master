 ## Industry background research
Owning a car is very common in modern society, for the car can bring much convenience and improve efficiency. There are 5.7 million people live in Singapore [1], while Singapore’s number of registered vehicles was reported at 826,824 units in Aug 2020[2]. It is obvious that Singapore’s vehicle market still has much potential. Besides, Singapore's motor vehicle sales recorded 5,835 units in Jul 2020, compared with 1,657 units in the previous month [3], which shows Singaporean have strong needs and purchasing power in this field.

From J. D. Power, a global market research website that conducts surveys of customer satisfaction and product quality of different car brands, Audi performed well in the previous decade [4]. Audi is also of great prevalence in Singapore, due to the annual market share of various brands [5], it is one of the top 10 locally popular brand

(here is a research table)

Under the influence of the COVID-19, global auto companies have been greatly affected, and Audi is no exception. According to the financial report, Audi achieved operating revenue of 20.476 billion euros in the first half of 2020, a decrease of 28.8% from 28.761 billion euros in the same period in 2019【6】. In this situation, Audi needs to make a breakthrough.

## Target users
Because of Audi’s dilemma, we design a car recommendation system to serve both the company and its customers, including pre-sale service and after-sale service.

The pre-sale service is mainly designed for those who would like to buy an Audi automobile. Even excluding the effect of the COVID-19, Audi has many potential customers who know little about a vehicle's parameters. Before a customer makes a final purchase decision, he (or she) may spend a long time researching the details of a car, including the structure, the engine, the displacement etc. While our recommendation system combines all these key parameters with customers' needs, the customer will never have trouble choosing a car when using our system. Besides, due to the virus, Singapore Government only allows at most five people to appear in one region, so it is inconvenient for a buyer to go to the real car market and choose the most suitable car. With our system's service, it will no need to make appointments with the car-salesperson, and the only thing a customer needs to do is to click the mouse.

The after-sale service can also bring customers a great deal of convenience. Buying a car not only means to buy the automobile itself but also contains the additional services, for instance, the insurance, the decoration and services from automobiles service centers. We will recommend some suitable insurance and decoration (depends on formal customers’ choices) for the new buyers. When customers need to send their cars to the automobiles service centers, our system can mark these service centers' positions and connect with the Google calendar to remind your appointment day with the service center.

As for the Audi company, it has more than 90 hundred staff, and salespeople are the main component of them. Also, an experienced salesperson needs to be fully trained. If head leaders in Audi company consider our system, they will save human resources and funds on salespeople's training and payment.

## Competitive product analysis
Based on our research, the Audi company does not have a complete online recommendation system (also the same as other car companies) so far. If Audi tries this solution, it will be ahead of their competitors. When it comes to the customers, they do not have an excellent recommendation system, which includes both pre-sale and after-sale services of a brand. If they intend to know details of a car, they prefer to collect information from the Internet and ask for advice from related forums or salespeople. However, this procedure usually lasts long, and other people's advice may not fit the need, for netizens would like to talk his (or her) preferred car, and some salespeople always express strong enthusiasm for the new style and ignore what the customer exactly need.

## Advantages of our car recommendation system
Under the influence of the epidemic situation, the sales method of car dealer mode is no longer widely applicable, and this situation will continue for a long time. The second point is that some current online car selection systems are not user-friendly in interface interaction. Most of them are related to the attributes and characteristics of the car. They do not take into account the portraits of different users and the real needs of customers. At the same time, the interface information is complicated, and there are many advertisements information, and user operations are cumbersome. Compared with these systems, our CarsAI relies on Google Dialogflow as the main front-end development tool. Users only need simple conversations about living habits to choose the car they want, and the interactive interface is simple and efficient. Meanwhile, the system still has other services such as car maintenance appointments, car dealer location guidance, etc., to meet user needs in one stop.
